<body>
I’m Rhea Srivastava, a sophomore at Syracuse University. With a passion for technology, social media, and all things creative, I chose to attend Syracuse as a dual-major in Advertising and Information Management & Technology. I am also completing an emphasis in digital advertising as well as a concentration in web design. I am currently developing skills in social media management, web design, marketing, and brand management through a variety of organizations and internship experiences. At Syracuse, I am a member of Women in Communications as well as digital director of University Girl Magazine. Outside of school, I am a social media intern for Off the Muck Market and a marketing intern for ASM Global’s Syracuse venues. Detail-oriented, self-motivated, and organized, I am always looking for new opportunities to gain experience in fields related to digital advertising.
Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, photography, and cooking. I love exploring the culture and food of new places. I have one younger brother who I always have Marvel movie marathons with, and two amazing parents who live back in Cincinnati, Ohio, where I am originally from. If there’s one thing I’ve learned during my college years, it’s that the East Coast is much better than the Midwest.

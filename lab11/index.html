    <p class="center">
        I’m Rhea Srivastava, a sophomore at Syracuse University. With a passion for technology, social media, and all things creative, I chose to attend Syracuse as a dual-major in <strong>Advertising</strong> and <strong>Information Management & Technology</strong>. I am also completing an emphasis in digital advertising as well as a concentration in web design. I am currently developing skills in social media management, web design, marketing, and brand management through a variety of organizations and internship experiences. 
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        At Syracuse, I am a member of <strong>Women in Communications</strong>, digital director of <strong>University Girl Magazine</strong>, and account strategy director of the <strong>TNH Advertising Agency</strong> Dinosaur BBQ account. Outside of school, I am a social media intern for <strong>Off the Muck Market</strong> and a marketing intern for <strong>ASM Global Syracuse Venues</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        Detail-oriented, self-motivated, and organized, I am always looking for new opportunities to gain experience in fields related to digital advertising

    <p class="center">
        Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, photography, and cooking. I love exploring the culture and food of new places. I have one younger brother who I always have Marvel movie marathons with, and two amazing parents who live back in Cincinnati, Ohio, where I am originally from. If there’s one thing I’ve learned during my college years, it’s that the East Coast is much better than the Midwest.

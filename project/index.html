                As a huge foodie, I love trying new restaurants. Unpopular opinion, but Syracuse satisfies. From show-stopping breakfasts at Rise N' Shine to the best bread and pesto sauce I’ve ever had at Pastabilities, Syracuse has a lot. And of course, we can’t forget about our OG: Original Grain. However, recently, tons of new restaurants have been opening in the Syracuse area, not to mention the ones that have totally revamped their menus. There are so many places I’ve been dying to try… but I don’t want to try them alone! I want your taste buds to share these experiences with me, so I created this website with the hopes of inspiring some of you to go out and eat some amazing food. From old favorites to new modern cuisines, this list really has it all. You can’t go wrong!

                There are three sections to this website based on when you feel like going out for a bite. I recommend you try at least a few from each one. Better yet, try them all! I know I’m going to!

                Happy Eating!

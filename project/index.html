                As a huge foodie, I love trying new restaurants. Unpopular opinion, but Syracuse satisfies. From show-stopper breakfasts at Rise N Shine to the best pasta I’ve had in my life at Pastabilities, Syracuse really does have a lot. And of course, we can’t forget about our precious OG Grain. However, recently, tons of new restaurants have been opening in Syracuse, not to mention all the ones that have totally revamped their menus. I mean, seriously, it’s crazy how many places I’ve been dying to try… but I don’t want to try them alone! I want you all to share these experiences with me, so I created this website with the hopes of inspiring some of you to go out and eat some amazing food. From old favorites to new modern cuisines, this list really has it all. You can’t go wrong!

                There are three sections to this website based on what time of the day you feel like going out for a bite. I recommend you try at least a few from each one. Better yet, try them all! I know I’m going to!
